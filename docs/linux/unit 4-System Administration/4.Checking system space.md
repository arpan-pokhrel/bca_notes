### 4. **Checking System Space:**
Checking system space refers to monitoring and analyzing the disk space utilization on a Linux system. This is crucial for system maintenance, ensuring that there's enough space for applications and preventing disk space-related issues. Below, I'll explain how to check system space in detail using several commands and provide sample outputs.

1. **df (Disk Free):**
   - `df` command displays information about disk space usage for mounted filesystems.

   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

   - The `-h` option makes the output human-readable (e.g., in gigabytes or megabytes). Sample output might look like this:

   ```bash
   Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
   /dev/sda1        50G   20G   28G  42% /
   /dev/sdb1       100G   80G   15G  85% /mnt/data
   ```

   - The columns represent the filesystem, total size, used space, available space, percentage used, and mount point.

2. **du (Disk Usage):**
   - `du` calculates the disk usage of files and directories.

   ```bash
   du -sh /path/to/directory
   ```

   - The `-s` option gives a summary total, and the `-h` option makes the output human-readable. For example:

   ```bash
   2.4G    /path/to/directory
   ```

   - This command shows the total size of the specified directory and its subdirectories.

3. **ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage):**
   - `ncdu` provides an interactive and more detailed view of disk usage.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ncdu  # Install if not already installed
   ncdu /path/to/directory
   ```

   - After running the command, you'll get an interactive interface that allows you to navigate through directories, view sizes, and delete files if necessary.

4. **ls (List Files):**
   - `ls` can help you identify large files in a directory.

   ```bash
   ls -lhS /path/to/directory | head -n 10
   ```

   - This command lists the largest files in a directory, sorted by size, with the largest files at the top.

5. **System Monitoring Tools:**
   - Tools like `top`, `htop`, and `iotop` provide real-time information about system resource usage, including CPU, memory, and disk activity. They can help identify processes or activities that are consuming disk space.

   ```bash
   top
   ```

   - `top` displays a dynamic view of system resource usage, including disk activity.
