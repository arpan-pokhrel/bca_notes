### Structure of Mobile Operating Systems

A mobile OS serves as a software platform upon which application programs run on mobile devices such as PDAs, cellular phones, and smartphones. Here's an overview of the structure of mobile operating systems:

#### Low-Level Hardware
- **Mobile Processors:** Utilize RISC architecture, primarily ARM processors and MIPS for embedded systems.
- **Mobile Memory:**
  - **ROM:** Stores operating system and preinstalled programs.
  - **RAM:**
    - DRAM (Dynamic RAM): Commonly used in mobile devices.
    - EDO (Enhanced Data Output), SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic RAM), DDR SDRAM, OUM (Ovonics Unified Memory) - Various types with different characteristics.

#### Kernel
- Responsible for services such as:
  - Security
  - Memory Management
  - Process Management
- Components include:
  - I/O Components
  - File Systems
  - Networking Components

#### Introduction to Development Environment
- **Native Apps:**
  - Installed directly onto a device from its associated app store.
  - Platform-dependent, designed for specific operating systems.
  - **Pros:**
    - Better performance
    - Easier development with platform SDKs
    - Better distribution and monetization through app stores
  - **Cons:**
    - Increased development time and costs
    - Higher maintenance costs
    - App store content restrictions and fees
- **HTML5 Apps:**
  - Delivered through an HTML5-enabled browser.
  - Platform-independent, accessible via any web browser.
  - **Pros:**
    - Platform independence
    - Easier updates and faster development
    - Cheaper development costs
    - No content restrictions or app store fees
  - **Cons:**
    - Poorer performance, especially with heavy graphics
    - Device fragmentation within web browsers
    - Technical limitations and limited monetization opportunities

#### Introduction to Android
- **Description:** A platform and operating system for mobile devices based on the Linux OS. Allows developers to design applications in a Java-like language using Google-developed Java libraries.
- **API Levels and Versions:** Android's version history began with the release of Android beta in November 2007. The first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released in September 2008. Android is under ongoing development by Google and the Open Handset Alliance (OHA), with numerous updates to its base operating system over time.

### Android Version History and Comparison with Other OSes

#### Android Version History:

- **Android 1.0 (API level 1) to Android 4.4W.2 KitKat (API level 20):**
  - Various versions with different names and API levels, introducing new features and improvements over time.

- **Android 5.0–5.1.1 Lollipop (API level 21–22):**
  - Continued evolution with new features and enhancements.

#### Pros of Android:
- **Open Source:** Android is an open-source operating system, allowing for customization and flexibility.
- **Wide Range of OEMs:** Numerous Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) produce Android devices, offering diverse options to consumers.
- **Google Support:** Google provides extensive support for Android users, solving their problems and offering various services.
- **Large App Selection:** Google Play Store offers a vast selection of apps, catering to diverse user needs.

#### Cons of Android:
- **Security Concerns:** Android is not as secure as iOS and Windows OS, making it susceptible to malware and other security threats.
- **App Store Clutter:** Google Play Store has a large number of apps, but many of them are of low quality or not frequently downloaded, leading to clutter and confusion.
- **App Compatibility Issues:** Compatibility issues may arise due to the fragmentation of Android devices running different OS versions.
- **Performance Degradation:** Over time, Android devices may become slow in operation, affecting user experience.
- **Battery Consumption:** Android OS and apps may consume battery quickly, leading to shorter battery life.

#### Comparison of Android with Other OSes:
- **App Availability:** Android has the largest number of apps in its store compared to Apple's App Store and Windows Store.
- **Feature Innovation:** Android introduced features like Wi-Fi Direct, multiple user accounts, and screen mirroring support ahead of other OSes.
- **OEM Diversity:** Android has over 100 OEMs, offering a wide range of device options, while iOS is limited to Apple Inc. and Windows has fewer OEMs.
- **Open Source vs. Closed Source:** Android is open source and customizable, whereas iOS and Windows are closed source, limiting customization options.
